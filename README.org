* Raspberry Pi Nexa Switch

Note: This program has only been tested on a Raspberry Pi 1 Model B.

** Compile the project

Run the following command in the =nexa= directory to build the project:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
gcc nexa.c nexalib/nexalib.c nexalib/gpio.c -std=gnu99 -o nexa
#+END_SRC

** How to use the program

Currently the program supports up to three devices but there are no problems to
add many more devices. Note that you need to run the command as root in order to
have permissions to use the gpio pins. To turn on or off a channel you run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# sudo ./nexa <channel> <on|off>
# e.g.

sudo ./nexa 1 on # Will turn on device number one
#+END_SRC

In order to send a command to all devices in the group you run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# sudo ./nexa group <on|off>
# e.g.

sudo ./nexa groip on
#+END_SRC
